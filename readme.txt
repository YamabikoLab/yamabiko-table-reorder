Accessible table row reordering for supported blocks in the WordPress block editor.

== Description ==

Yamabiko Table Reorder lets you reorder body rows in supported table blocks while preserving the block's content structure.

Features include:

* Drag-and-drop row reordering with a dedicated handle.
* Keyboard and destination-selection interactions for row reordering.
* Touch interaction for row reordering.
* Support for iframe and non-iframe editors.
* Protection against invalid moves across vertically merged cells (`rowspan`).
* Synchronization of the reordered table back to Gutenberg block attributes.

This plugin is under active development. Behavior and specifications may change in future releases.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3.3 =

= 0.3.2 =

* Changed: Shortened the Table Reorder operation guidance and improved it with a compact pill-style UI.

* Changed: Unified the Table Reorder guidance panel design for Keyboard and Touch interactions and added icons that match the current operation.

* Changed: Consolidated Core Table and Flexible Table Block-specific differences behind a thin block support boundary.

* Changed: Avoid running Table Reorder-specific hooks for unsupported blocks.
* Changed: Removed unused compatibility APIs, arguments, calculations, and controller-specific test fixtures.
* Fixed: Prevented row-reorder handles from overlapping content in a narrow first column on mobile by expanding only when needed and allowing horizontal scrolling temporarily.
