# Table Reorder

Table Reorder extends the Core Table block with row reordering powered by SortableJS.

## Implementation overview

- `with-table-reorder.tsx` is the thin Gutenberg composition and rendering adapter.
- `use-table-reorder.ts` connects Gutenberg notices / `setAttributes()` to the dedicated interaction and controller hooks.
- `use-table-reorder-interaction.ts` owns hover capability, input modality, touch reorder mode, and coachmark preferences.
- `use-table-reorder-controller.ts` owns SortableJS controller creation, cleanup, recreation, and focus restoration.
- `controller/sortable-controller.ts` owns imperative keyboard / pointer / drag session orchestration.
- SortableJS temporarily reorders Gutenberg-owned `<tbody><tr>` elements during dragging.
- The selected Table is resolved from its owning `document`, so the same implementation works in iframe and non-iframe editors.
- SortableJS is initialized in the `window` that owns the target Table.
- On hover-capable devices, hovering a movable row reveals an inline handle at the left edge of the first cell. Dragging starts only from that handle, not from the row itself.
- On touch devices, reorder mode shows the same row controls. Tapping a handle starts destination selection, while dragging the handle starts SortableJS DnD. Long-pressing a row does not start DnD.
- Touch cell taps remain available for normal editing, and scrolling outside the row handles is not intercepted by Table Reorder.
- Rows involved in vertical merges (`rowspan`) cannot be moved, and insertion positions that would split a merged range are rejected.
- An insertion line shows the destination while dragging.
- At drag end, the temporary DOM order is restored before `setAttributes()` commits the reordered `body`, returning DOM ownership to Gutenberg.
- SortableJS provides the sorting animation and auto-scroll behavior.

Responsibility boundaries:

- `index.tsx`: registers the HOC with `editor.BlockEdit` and loads the editor styles.
- `with-table-reorder.tsx`: identifies `core/table`, renders the original `BlockEdit`, renders touch reorder controls, and provides the hidden anchor used to locate the Table DOM.
- `use-table-reorder.ts`: connects Gutenberg notices and `setAttributes()` to the lower-level Table Reorder hooks and returns the state / commands consumed by the HOC.
- `use-table-reorder-interaction.ts`: owns hover capability, input modality, touch reorder mode, coachmark preferences, and the interaction mode passed to the controller lifecycle.
- `use-table-reorder-controller.ts`: owns controller creation / destruction / recreation, delayed lifecycle safety, and focus restoration after body commits.
- `controller/sortable-controller.ts`: owns SortableJS callbacks, movable-row hover detection, keyboard / single-pointer sessions, mutable drag session state, temporary block-drag suppression, DOM ownership handoff, and controller cleanup. PC and touch both configure SortableJS with the shared row-control handle, so rows themselves are never drag-start areas.
- `controller/reorder-ui/index.ts`: compatibility facade that re-exports the existing reorder UI API for current consumers. It owns no UI lifecycle logic.
- `controller/reorder-ui/row-controls.ts`: owns row-control creation and cleanup, representative row text, accessible descriptions / Tooltip state, visibility, pressed state, cell style restoration, and the row-control propagation boundary.
- `controller/reorder-ui/reorder-guidance.ts`: owns operation guidance positioning / cleanup and keyboard destination scrolling.
- `controller/reorder-ui/row-move-targets.ts`: owns pointer / touch destination buttons, touch cancellation, tap-vs-swipe handling, positioning, guidance integration, and cleanup.
- `controller/reorder-ui/live-status.ts`: owns document-scoped assistive-technology status announcements and their visually-hidden / ARIA contract.
- `table-context.ts`: resolves the Table block and its owning `document`, `window`, `table`, and `tbody`, including iframe fallback.
- `controller/sortable-runtime.ts`: loads or reuses the SortableJS runtime in the owning editor window.
- `controller/drag-ui.ts`: owns short-lived drag UI and restoration, including the insertion line and fallback row widths.
- `controller/row-order.ts`: owns deterministic row reordering, movement validation, insertion index calculation, valid destination calculation, and restoration of the original DOM row order.
- `rowspan.ts`: owns vertical-merge range analysis and movement / insertion restrictions.
- `messages.ts`: owns translated Table Reorder messages and accessible labels.
- `editor.scss`: owns editor-side presentation for row controls and destination-selection UI.

The former `controller/touch-press.ts` long-press tracker is no longer needed. Touch DnD uses the same handle boundary as PC, so cell taps and normal table scrolling do not require a separate press tracker or touch-mode pointer-event suppression.

The dependency direction stays from the Gutenberg / React boundary toward lower-level modules. Current consumers continue to import the reorder UI contract through `controller/reorder-ui`; among the UI modules, `row-move-targets.ts` depends only on `row-controls.ts` and `reorder-guidance.ts`, and the lower-level UI modules do not depend back on the facade.

## Build integration

The extension entry is:

```text
src/editor-extensions/table-reorder/index.tsx
```

`webpack.config.js` emits the npm-provided `sortablejs/Sortable.min.js` runtime into the Table Reorder build directory. `yamabiko-table-reorder.php` enqueues the editor entry and exposes the local runtime URL to the editor script.

Run:

```bash
logcut npm run test
logcut npm run build
```

## iframe and non-iframe editors

The block is resolved with this rule:

1. Look for `[data-block="<clientId>"]` in the React anchor's owning `document`.
2. If it is not there, look for the same block in `iframe[name="editor-canvas"]`.
3. Once found, use `blockElement.ownerDocument` and that document's `defaultView` for the Table and SortableJS runtime.

This keeps one drag-and-drop implementation for both editor modes.

## DOM ownership handoff

SortableJS physically moves `<tr>` nodes while dragging, but Gutenberg/React remains the canonical owner of those nodes.

```text
Gutenberg renders canonical DOM
        ↓
SortableJS temporarily moves <tr> nodes during drag
        ↓
onEnd receives the destination index
        ↓
Original <tr> DOM order is restored
        ↓
setAttributes({ body: reorderedBody })
        ↓
Gutenberg renders the new canonical DOM order
```
